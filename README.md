# GUI for Crowdstrike API sample app

Inspired from this repo from Microsoft: https://github.com/microsoft/mde-api-gui/

## Pros

- No installation of FalconSDK needed
- Quick to execute and simple GUI
- Very useful in case of critical incident

- Will be more difficult to keep up to date

Note: this has nothing to do with Microsoft. It is just a sample GUI app for Crowdstrike API.

## Scopes for Crowdstrike API Client

- Hosts (Read / Write)

## Implementation (in progress)

- Connect to Crowdstrike API client and get token with good CID scope: ✅
- Tagging: tested ✅
